# Simulations on different Caching Strategies

## Description:
We are testing the impact of different caching strategies such as LRU & Cyclic on the Operating System.
<br>We test multiple parameters, including memory size, data size, data variance, Spatial locality and Temporal locality.

## Instructions:
- Go to: experiment > Experiment.ipynb
- Open as Jupyter Notebook

## Recommendations:
- Do not re-run code cells in order to keep pre-obtained results
